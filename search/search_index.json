The stage will showcase what's possible to use in a very simple level structure. The prototype WILL NOT implement any boss fight or story telling, as its main purpose is to test the core mechanics. Please refer to the Prototype section for more informations. Quick description In Twin Souls , each player incarnates a Twin. Twins are wizzards, in a fantasy world were magic is everything. What makes the Twins special is that they have a magical bond with each other, allowing them to mix their magic together. Twins can dynamically switch of elements while resolving puzzles or in the middle of fighting monsters. Mixing their elements can be done in a clever way, making the Twins more efficient during fights. But if done hastly, the result can become harmfull (getting lethal) for the Twins. Since Twins are sharing a special bond, one cannot live without the other. If a Twin dies, the other will follow its sibling. Twin Souls is a cooperation game, where communication is the key to success. Inspiration Magicka 2 is the main source of inspiration for Twin Souls . Magicka 2 offers a very complex combat mechanic based on spell creation. Players have to combine up to 5 different elements together in order to cast a spell. The spell possibilities are so complex and countless, that the player most likely understands and masters the spell system only when reaching the end of the game.

You have to see the link as a mean for a Twin to constantly try affecting the other. This way a Twin affected by a complementary element, results in a boost. On the other hand if he gets affected by a stronger element, the Twin will suffer from the strong element effects. Essentially, a Twin emitting \ud83d\udd25 receiving \u26a1\ufe0f through the link, so enhancing him, is the very same as a Twin emitting \ud83d\udd25 getting hit by a \u26a1\ufe0f attack. \u2755 The element principles can be applied to any type of entity (enemies included) Element expression rules The \ud83d\udcda\ufe0f Link logical rule - Reminder in mind, we will consider the following expressions where an attack element can either be a element from an enemy attack, or an element going through the link, reaching the Twin . Expression format \u26ab\ufe0f, \ud83d\udd35 and \ud83d\udd34 are elements. an expression like: \u26ab\ufe0f&\ud83d\udd35 \u2192 [ \ud83d\udd34 ] = ( \u26ab\ufe0f + \ud83d\udd35 + \ud83d\udd34) Is explained this way: attack element(s) \u2192 [emitted element] = ( element equation ) = optional simplification Rules An element equation should not contain a same element multiple times, remove the duplicates The emitted element should always be prior to any changes Processing an element equation in steps: Removing the duplicates Removing the elements weaker than the emitted element Removing the emitted element if a stronger element is present in the equation \u2192 we'll be calling {t} the time of the effect related to the stronger element Conclude with the result: If the result is empty, the entity stops emitting for {t} . If the result does not contain the emitted element, apply the result's effect to the entity. The entity stops emitting for {t} . If the result contains only the emitted element, no changes to apply. If the result contains the emitted element and other elements, continue emitting and add the other elements as boost effects.

While moving around, players started switching their elements over randomly and ended up dying 2 times to \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0f Fusion & Repression caused by the \ud83d\udd25 burning effect. The actual activation of the two pressure plates went very smoothly, players instantly knew what they had to do. Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates Both player were very confused at first. After moving and shooting around, they understood that boxes could be affected by spells and be moved as well. With that in mind, players easyly understood how to trigger the 4 pressure plates.

After shooting the pillars for a couple of minutes, players finally figured out that the 4 pillars were actually switches. Activating the first \u2744\ufe0f \ud83d\udca7 pillar was easy enough, but the players took a fair amount of time to think about both using the same element to activate the \u26a1\ufe0f pillar.

Players in this session have never even opened the game before. Please note that the players in this session are not the same as the Discovery session #1 . Area 1 - Pressure plate As in the Discovery session #1 , players used this area as their playground to start moving around and testing the voting system. \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0f Fusion & Repression caused by the \ud83d\udd25 burning effect nearly killed them once, they reacted in time and changed their votes. As in the previous session, pressure plates were not a struggle in the slightest. Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates Players were confused and took quite some time finding out they could hit the boxes. When they did figure it out, it did not take long to activate the pressure plates. They quickly realised they could shoot the pillars to change them, but for a few seconds did not understand why the already activated pillar (changed in Discovery session #1 tweaking part) was not changing when hit. When they understood the pillar was actually active by default, they understood that every pillars needed to be lighten up. Like the previous duo, it took some time to have the idea of using the same element to activated the pillars. For the \ud83d\udca7 \u26a1\ufe0f pillar, they did also come up with a rather complex set up to solve it, but did not try it because they felt like it was way to complex. They solved the puzzle as intended. Area 3 - Movement ability Dashing above the void was instant for them (as the previous duo). However they got stuck a fair minute in front of the wall obstructing the way. Players tried changing elements to detroy it, before trying the \u26a1\ufe0f moving ability to flash it. One of the players glitched over the wall by timing the \ud83d\udd25 dash. After understanding how diffrent movement abilities could be, they quickly understood they had to cast their \u2744\ufe0f movement ability to get over with this area. Area 4 - Training ground Players tried swinging the different weapons for a VERY LONG TIME. Seems like they had way to much fun shooting around while dashing in every corner of the room. As good as it sounds, I actually had to interfer since they had a hard time understanding how the element mechanic worked when applied to fighting. Area 5 - Monster waves Players had a hard time communicating with each other and died 3 times pointlessly, they were not focusing at all since they were laughing the whole tries looking at how unorganized they were. After getting the hang of dodging and moving around, it was just a matter of time (and some more deaths) to clear all the waves. Players complained about their own movement speed being to slow to dodge the projectiles without dashing. Players also complained about the melee attacks, unable to reach the enemies since enemies were faster than the players. Conclusion The previous tweaking from Discovery session #1 are very efficient but not enough for the Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates in terms of feedbacking. The combat need some more balancing as well. Overall, I am very happy with the movement and fighting mechanics, in both sessions, players had a blast using them. Tweaking Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates : The activated pillar was a great tweak, however I've added a green outline to the pillars when activated to make players understand better what is happening. Increasing the boxes outline width to give a better feel that players can interact with them.

As in the previous session, pressure plates were not a struggle in the slightest.","title":"Area 1 - Pressure plate"},{"location":"playtesting/discovery-session2/#area-2-pillars-pressure-plates","text":"Players were confused and took quite some time finding out they could hit the boxes. When they did figure it out, it did not take long to activate the pressure plates. They quickly realised they could shoot the pillars to change them, but for a few seconds did not understand why the already activated pillar (changed in Discovery session #1 tweaking part) was not changing when hit. When they understood the pillar was actually active by default, they understood that every pillars needed to be lighten up. Like the previous duo, it took some time to have the idea of using the same element to activated the pillars. For the \ud83d\udca7 \u26a1\ufe0f pillar, they did also come up with a rather complex set up to solve it, but did not try it because they felt like it was way to complex. They solved the puzzle as intended.","title":"Area 2 - Pillars &amp; pressure plates"},{"location":"playtesting/discovery-session2/#area-3-movement-ability","text":"Dashing above the void was instant for them (as the previous duo). However they got stuck a fair minute in front of the wall obstructing the way. Players tried changing elements to detroy it, before trying the \u26a1\ufe0f moving ability to flash it. One of the players glitched over the wall by timing the \ud83d\udd25 dash. After understanding how diffrent movement abilities could be, they quickly understood they had to cast their \u2744\ufe0f movement ability to get over with this area.","title":"Area 3 - Movement ability"},{"location":"playtesting/discovery-session2/#area-4-training-ground","text":"Players tried swinging the different weapons for a VERY LONG TIME. Seems like they had way to much fun shooting around while dashing in every corner of the room. As good as it sounds, I actually had to interfer since they had a hard time understanding how the element mechanic worked when applied to fighting.","title":"Area 4 - Training ground"},{"location":"playtesting/discovery-session2/#area-5-monster-waves","text":"Players had a hard time communicating with each other and died 3 times pointlessly, they were not focusing at all since they were laughing the whole tries looking at how unorganized they were. After getting the hang of dodging and moving around, it was just a matter of time (and some more deaths) to clear all the waves. Players complained about their own movement speed being to slow to dodge the projectiles without dashing. Players also complained about the melee attacks, unable to reach the enemies since enemies were faster than the players.","title":"Area 5 - Monster waves"},{"location":"playtesting/discovery-session2/#conclusion","text":"The previous tweaking from Discovery session #1 are very efficient but not enough for the Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates in terms of feedbacking. The combat need some more balancing as well. Overall, I am very happy with the movement and fighting mechanics, in both sessions, players had a blast using them.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"playtesting/discovery-session2/#tweaking","text":"Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates : The activated pillar was a great tweak, however I've added a green outline to the pillars when activated to make players understand better what is happening.
