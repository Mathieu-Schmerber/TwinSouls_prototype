Players in this session have never even opened the game before. Area 1 - Pressure plate Both player used this very simple area to start moving around, testing the movement abilities and swinging their axes, enjoying the simple fireball spell casting. While moving around, players started switching their elements over randomly and ended up dying 2 times to \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0f Fusion & Repression caused by the \ud83d\udd25 burning effect. The actual activation of the two pressure plates went very smoothly, players instantly knew what they had to do. Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates Both player were very confused at first. After moving and shooting around, they understood that boxes could be affected by spells and be moved as well. With that in mind, players easyly understood how to trigger the 4 pressure plates. Seeing the door not opening, they started to ask what the pillars were about. After shooting the pillars for a couple of minutes, players finally figured out that the 4 pillars were actually switches. Activating the first \u2744\ufe0f \ud83d\udca7 pillar was easy enough, but the players took a fair amount of time to think about both using the same element to activate the \u26a1\ufe0f pillar. Activating the \u26a1\ufe0f \ud83d\udca7 pillar was a real struggle and players came up with very complex setups, before realizing that the activation time of this last pillar was far greater than the others. Players made it in the intended way (both using \u26a1\ufe0f then both using \ud83d\udca7). During this area, players died once to \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0f Fusion & Repression caused by the \ud83d\udd25 burning effect. Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates This part went very smoothly since both players thoroughly enjoyed dashing around since the very beginning. They quickly realised that the boxes could have timers on them, and that they had to use the \u2744\ufe0fmobility ability, howerver it did take some time to come to this ability usage conclusion since they started by shooting as quickly as possible. Area 4 - Training ground Player A was quite in a rush to skip this area without really caring much about it, but was restricted by Player B since both players are required to open the door. Player B spent quite some time playing around with the weapon choices. This player really cared about finding out how the element combinations worked together by hitting the dummies. This was a great show, as Player B needed to also share with Player A what were discovered. Both players started to understand how complex the system was and were very confused, starting to realise that they will need to be using their head more from now on. Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates Players died 3 times during the first wave since they didn't realize how communication was important whenever switching elements. Players complained a lot about the speed of the enemies beiing to great and their aim beiing nearly perfect. It took another 2 deaths for them to realise that they could use their movement abilities to dodge spells and even damage enemies. In total, players died 7 times.

When they did figure it out, it did not take long to activate the pressure plates. They quickly realised they could shoot the pillars to change them, but for a few seconds did not understand why the already activated pillar (changed in Discovery session #1 tweaking part) was not changing when hit. When they understood the pillar was actually active by default, they understood that every pillars needed to be lighten up. Like the previous duo, it took some time to have the idea of using the same element to activated the pillars. For the \ud83d\udca7 \u26a1\ufe0f pillar, they did also come up with a rather complex set up to solve it, but did not try it because they felt like it was way to complex.

However they got stuck a fair minute in front of the wall obstructing the way. Players tried changing elements to detroy it, before trying the \u26a1\ufe0f moving ability to flash it. One of the players glitched over the wall by timing the \ud83d\udd25 dash. After understanding how diffrent movement abilities could be, they quickly understood they had to cast their \u2744\ufe0f movement ability to get over with this area. Area 4 - Training ground Players tried swinging the different weapons for a VERY LONG TIME. Seems like they had way to much fun shooting around while dashing in every corner of the room. As good as it sounds, I actually had to interfer since they had a hard time understanding how the element mechanic worked when applied to fighting. Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates Players had a hard time communicating with each other and died 3 times pointlessly, they were not focusing at all since they were laughing the whole tries looking at how unorganized they were. After getting the hang of dodging and moving around, it was just a matter of time (and some more deaths) to clear all the waves. Players complained about their own movement speed being to slow to dodge the projectiles without dashing. Players also complained about the melee attacks, unable to reach the enemies since enemies were faster than the players. Conclusion The previous tweaking from Discovery session #1 are very efficient but not enough for the Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates in terms of feedbacking. The combat need some more balancing as well. Overall, I am very happy with the movement and fighting mechanics, in both sessions, players had a blast using them.
