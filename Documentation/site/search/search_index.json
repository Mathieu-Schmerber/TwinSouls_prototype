What makes the Twins special is that they have a magical bond with each other, allowing them to mix their magic together. Twins can dynamically switch between elements while resolving puzzles or in the middle of fighting monsters. Mixing their elements can be done in a clever way, making the Twins more efficient during fights. But if done hastily, the result can become harmful (getting lethal) for the Twins. Since Twins are sharing a special bond, one cannot live without the other. If a Twin dies, the other will follow its sibling. Twin Souls is a cooperation game, where communication is the key to success. Twin Souls is designed to have a very complex mechanic to only be understood and mastered by players after a fair amount of time playing. What makes Twin Souls fun ? Twin Souls offers a satisfying movement system, providing fancy abilities. Everything a player inputs provides clear visual feedbacks, it is simply fun to move around to begin with. But Twin Souls has more to it. Twin Souls promises an experience where you and your team mate will need to put some reflexion into solving complex puzzles and even when fighting. Soon enough, you'll find out how annoyingly funny it is to die by your teammate's mistake ! Inspiration Magicka 2 is the main source of inspiration for Twin Souls . Magicka 2 offers a very complex combat mechanic based on spell creation. Players have to combine up to 5 different elements together in order to cast a spell. The spell possibilities are so complex and countless, that the player most likely understands and masters the spell system only when reaching the end of the game. Market opportunities Twin Souls is for anyone who is willing to have fun cooperating with a friend. Nowadays the game industry is overwhelmed by the omni presence of AAA Games from big companies and gamers are more and more complaining about the lack of new indie games and cooperative ones at that. This is part of why games like A Way Out , It takes two or Death loop more recently have met the success we all know about. This is a perfect opportunity for Twin Souls to meet the players expectations.

You have to see the link as a mean for a Twin to constantly try affecting the other. This way a Twin affected by a complementary element, results in a boost. On the other hand if he gets affected by a stronger element, the Twin will suffer from the strong element effects. Essentially, a Twin emitting \ud83d\udd25 receiving \u26a1\ufe0f through the link, so enhancing him, is the very same as a Twin emitting \ud83d\udd25 getting hit by a \u26a1\ufe0f attack. \u2755 The element principles can be applied to any type of entity (enemies included) Element expression rules The \ud83d\udcda\ufe0f Link logical rule - Reminder in mind, we will consider the following expressions where an attack element can either be a element from an enemy attack, or an element going through the link, reaching the Twin . Expression format \u26ab\ufe0f, \ud83d\udd35 and \ud83d\udd34 are elements. an expression like: \u26ab\ufe0f&\ud83d\udd35 \u2192 [ \ud83d\udd34 ] = ( \u26ab\ufe0f + \ud83d\udd35 + \ud83d\udd34) Is explained this way: attack element(s) \u2192 [emitted element] = ( element equation ) = optional simplification Rules An element equation should not contain a same element multiple time, remove the duplicates The emitted element should always be prior to any changes Processing an element equation in steps: Removing the duplicates Removing the elements weaker than the emitted element Removing the emitted element if a stronger element is present in the equation \u2192 we'll be calling {t} the time of the effect related to the stronger element Conclude with the result: If the result is empty, the entity stops emitting for {t} . If the result does not contain the emitted element, apply the result's effect to the entity. The entity stops emitting for {t} . If the result contains only the emitted element, no changes to apply. If the result contains the emitted element and other elements, continue emitting and add the other elements as boost effects.

Tweaking Here is the list of tweaking done after the balancing sessions, taking the testers inputs into account: \ud83d\udd25 Burning effect: 5 damages/second \u2192 10 damages/second \u2764\ufe0f Twin health bar: 100hp \u2192 200hp Axe: Melee damage: 10 \u2192 15 (first attack) 10 \u2192 7 (second attack which contains two hits) Projectile damage: 15 \u2192 10 Projectile speed: 10 \u2192 12 Sword: Melee damage: 8 \u2192 5 (first attack) 5 \u2192 7 (second attack which contains two hits) Projectile damage: 7 \u2192 5 Staff: Projectile damage: 7 \u2192 10 Projectile speed: 12 \u2192 15 Bow: Projectile damage: 15 \u2192 30 (one shot) Melee damage: 5 \u2192 0 (no melee allowed) Can now pierce through 2 entities Weapons now have better identities as their caracteristics and play style are very different from each other. The bow is designed as a more skilled weapon, most likely a coin flip choice, if you are not aiming correctly you are useless since no melee damage are possible at all.","title":"Balancing sessions"},{"location":"playtesting/balancing-session/#tweaking","text":"Here is the list of tweaking done after the balancing sessions, taking the testers inputs into account: \ud83d\udd25 Burning effect: 5 damages/second \u2192 10 damages/second \u2764\ufe0f Twin health bar: 100hp \u2192 200hp Axe: Melee damage: 10 \u2192 15 (first attack) 10 \u2192 7 (second attack which contains two hits) Projectile damage: 15 \u2192 10 Projectile speed: 10 \u2192 12 Sword: Melee damage: 8 \u2192 5 (first attack) 5 \u2192 7 (second attack which contains two hits) Projectile damage: 7 \u2192 5 Staff: Projectile damage: 7 \u2192 10 Projectile speed: 12 \u2192 15 Bow: Projectile damage: 15 \u2192 30 (one shot) Melee damage: 5 \u2192 0 (no melee allowed) Can now pierce through 2 entities Weapons now have better identities as their caracteristics and play style are very different from each other.

Players in this session have never even opened the game before. Area 1 - Pressure plate Both player used this very simple area to start moving around, testing the movement abilities and swinging their axes, enjoying the simple fireball spell casting. While moving around, players started switching their elements over randomly and ended up dying 2 times to \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0f Fusion & Repression caused by the \ud83d\udd25 burning effect. The actual activation of the two pressure plates went very smoothly, players instantly knew what they had to do. Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates Both player were very confused at first. After moving and shooting around, they understood that boxes could be affected by spells and be moved as well. With that in mind, players easily understood how to trigger the 4 pressure plates. Seeing the door not opening, they started to ask what the pillars were about. After shooting the pillars for a couple of minutes, players finally figured out that the 4 pillars were actually switches. Activating the first \u2744\ufe0f \ud83d\udca7 pillar was easy enough, but the players took a fair amount of time to think about both using the same element to activate the \u26a1\ufe0f pillar. Activating the \u26a1\ufe0f \ud83d\udca7 pillar was a real struggle and players came up with very complex setups, before realizing that the activation time of this last pillar was far greater than the others. Players made it in the intended way (both using \u26a1\ufe0f then both using \ud83d\udca7). During this area, players died once to \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0f Fusion & Repression caused by the \ud83d\udd25 burning effect. Area 3 - Movement ability This part went very smoothly since both players thoroughly enjoyed dashing around since the very beginning. They quickly realised that the boxes could have timers on them, and that they had to use the \u2744\ufe0fmobility ability, however it did take some time to come to this ability usage conclusion since they started by shooting as quickly as possible. Area 4 - Training ground Player A was quite in a rush to skip this area without really caring much about it, but was restricted by Player B since both players are required to open the door. Player B spent quite some time playing around with the weapon choices. This player really cared about finding out how the element combinations worked together by hitting the dummies. This was a great show, as Player B needed to also share with Player A what were discovered. Both players started to understand how complex the system was and were very confused, starting to realise that they will need to be using their head more from now on. Area 5 - Monster waves Players died 3 times during the first wave since they didn't realize how communication was important whenever switching elements. Players complained a lot about the speed of the enemies being to great and their aim being nearly perfect. It took another 2 deaths for them to realise that they could use their movement abilities to dodge spells and even damage enemies. In total, players died 7 times. Conclusion The game is lacking feedbacks on the puzzle side, where on the combat side enemies are probably to strong. Also players died a lot to \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0f Fusion & Repression , so the \ud83d\udd25 burning effect needs to be reduced.

Area 1 - Pressure plate As in the Discovery session #1 , players used this area as their playground to start moving around and testing the voting system. \ud83d\udd0d\ufe0f Fusion & Repression caused by the \ud83d\udd25 burning effect nearly killed them once, they reacted in time and changed their votes. As in the previous session, pressure plates were not a struggle in the slightest. Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates Players were confused and took quite some time finding out they could hit the boxes. When they did figure it out, it did not take long to activate the pressure plates. They quickly realised they could shoot the pillars to change them, but for a few seconds did not understand why the already activated pillar (changed in Discovery session #1 tweaking part) was not changing when hit. When they understood the pillar was actually active by default, they understood that every pillars needed to be lighten up. Like the previous duo, it took some time to have the idea of using the same element to activated the pillars. For the \ud83d\udca7 \u26a1\ufe0f pillar, they did also come up with a rather complex set up to solve it, but did not try it because they felt like it was way to complex. They solved the puzzle as intended. Area 3 - Movement ability Dashing above the void was instant for them (as the previous duo). However they got stuck a fair minute in front of the wall obstructing the way. Players tried changing elements to detroy it, before trying the \u26a1\ufe0f moving ability to flash it. One of the players glitched over the wall by timing the \ud83d\udd25 dash. After understanding how diffrent movement abilities could be, they quickly understood they had to cast their \u2744\ufe0f movement ability to get over with this area. Area 4 - Training ground Players tried swinging the different weapons for a VERY LONG TIME. Seems like they had way to much fun shooting around while dashing in every corner of the room. As good as it sounds, I actually had to interfer since they had a hard time understanding how the element mechanic worked when applied to fighting. Area 5 - Monster waves Players had a hard time communicating with each other and died 3 times pointlessly, they were not focusing at all since they were laughing the whole tries looking at how unorganized they were. After getting the hang of dodging and moving around, it was just a matter of time (and some more deaths) to clear all the waves. Players complained about their own movement speed being to slow to dodge the projectiles without dashing. Players also complained about the melee attacks, unable to reach the enemies since enemies were faster than the players. Conclusion The previous tweaking from Discovery session #1 are very efficient but not enough for the Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates in terms of feedbacking. The combat need some more balancing as well. Overall, I am very happy with the movement and fighting mechanics, in both sessions, players had a blast using them. Tweaking Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates : The activated pillar was a great tweak, however I've added a green outline to the pillars when activated to make players understand better what is happening. Increasing the boxes outline width to give a better feel that players can interact with them.

The pressure plates will be of element \ud83d\udd25 and \u26a1\ufe0f which are complementary.

To make it more interesting let's make the pressure plate activatable by ANY entities standing on it. Also the pressure plate can only be activated by emitting a specific element when standing on it. This way, it will be possible to have interesting level designs, we could imagine a level where players need to bait a monster into walking on a pressure plate of its element. Prototype design Pressure plate needing an entity emitting \u2744\ufe0f element to stand on \u231b\ufe0f Elemental pillar The elemental pillar will be an entity acting as a switch. By design, it will look like a pillar with incrusted gemstones taking the form of the elements from the \ud83c\udfa1 Elements equality wheel . To be activated, it will require to have its 4 gemstones to be lighten up. To light up a gemstone, player needs to cast a spell on the pillar of the same element as what the gemstone represents. To make it interesting, when the pillar gets hit with an element already activated, it should switch of the corresponding gemstone. This way, players would need to manage their elements and boosts through the link, as they could turn on and turn off gemstones if they are not cautious enough. To avoid the setup to be to easily solved, a solution needs to be found to somehow limit the player actions on the pillar, while still making a puzzle enable to be solved. EDIT solution found: Whenever the pillar is hit, a short timer starts and at the end of it, the pillar should reset to its initial state. This way players will need to be quick enough to react and will need some time to create a little strategy in their element voting system. Prototype design Pillar needing to be hit by the \u26a1\ufe0f element and ONLY the \u26a1\ufe0f element. New design after playtesting Players had a hard time figuring out what was going on whith the pillar reseting, so I've added a visual timer underneath.

By design, it will look like a pillar with incrusted gemstones taking the form of the elements from the \ud83c\udfa1 Elements equality wheel . To be activated, it will require to have its 4 gemstones to be lighten up. To light up a gemstone, player needs to cast a spell on the pillar of the same element as what the gemstone represents. To make it interesting, when the pillar gets hit with an element already activated, it should switch of the corresponding gemstone. This way, players would need to manage their elements and boosts through the link, as they could turn on and turn off gemstones if they are not cautious enough. To avoid the setup to be to easily solved, a solution needs to be found to somehow limit the player actions on the pillar, while still making a puzzle enable to be solved. EDIT solution found: Whenever the pillar is hit, a short timer starts and at the end of it, the pillar should reset to its initial state. This way players will need to be quick enough to react and will need some time to create a little strategy in their element voting system. Prototype design Pillar needing to be hit by the \u26a1\ufe0f element and ONLY the \u26a1\ufe0f element. New design after playtesting Players had a hard time figuring out what was going on whith the pillar reseting, so I've added a visual timer underneath. Pillar on the verge of reseting, the timer is represented by a circle disappearing reversed clockwisely.","title":"\u231b\ufe0f Elemental pillar"},{"location":"prototype/puzzle/#elemental-box","text":"The elemental box will be a simple entity, moveable by the players. The box can get hit by a spell, and will absorb the spell element to then emit it. This way the box can also trigger the pressure plates, addind a new possibilities of level designs. Edit after level designing the prototype : A variant of the box has been included. An elemental box can have a timer (similar to the elemental pillar) which resets the box element after being hit. This way we can restrict the players to activate the boxes only by casting movement abilities.
