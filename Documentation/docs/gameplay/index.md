This game design document will go over every core mechanics of <ins>Twin Souls</ins>.

## What's Twin Souls ?

### Prototype scope

The prototype **WILL** be implementing the core mechanics of <ins>Twin Souls</ins>, but will be restrained to a single stage. <br/>
The stage will showcase what's possible to use in a very simple level structure. <br/>
The prototype **WILL NOT** implement any boss fight or story telling, as its main purpose is to test the core mechanics. <br/>

Please refer to the [Prototype section](<../prototype/index.md>) for more informations.

### Quick description

In <ins>Twin Souls</ins>, each player incarnates a Twin. <br/>
Twins are wizzards, in a fantasy world were magic is everything. <br/>
What makes the Twins special is that they have a magical bond with each other, allowing them to mix their magic together. <br/>
Twins can dynamically switch of elements while resolving puzzles or in the middle of fighting monsters. <br/>
Mixing their elements can be done in a clever way, making the Twins more efficient during fights. 
But if done hastly, the result can become harmfull (getting lethal) for the Twins. <br/>
Since Twins are sharing a special bond, one cannot live without the other. If a Twin dies, the other will follow its sibling. <br/>

<ins>Twin Souls</ins> is a cooperation game, where communication is the key to success.

### Inspiration

Magicka 2 is the main source of inspiration for <ins>Twin Souls</ins>. <br/>
Magicka 2 offers a very complex combat mechanic based on spell creation.<br/>
Players have to combine up to 5 different elements together in order to cast a spell. <br/>
The spell possibilities are so complex and countless, that the player most likely understands and masters the spell system only when reaching the end of the game.
