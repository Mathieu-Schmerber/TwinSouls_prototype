## Overview

This section is only applicable to the [Twins](<../Twin.md>).

A [Twin](<../Twin.md>) emitting an element, has a granted access to a spell kit. 
Each element has its corresponding spell kit composed of a movement ability.

While repressed, a [Twin](<../Twin.md>) cannot use a spell kit.

## Movement abilities

Moving abilities are defined according to their element.

* 🔥 Kit: Dash releasing fire pits behind the [Twin](<../Twin.md>).
  > Any entity walking on the pits gets attacked by the 🔥 effect.

* 💧 Kit: Dash applying the 💧 effect to every entity the [Twin](<../Twin.md>) passes through.
* ⚡️Kit: Flash (short ranged teleportation)
* ❄️Kit: Creates an iced area.
  > [Twins](<../Twin.md>) are quicker on the area while enemies are slowed.

**Movement abilities are affected by boosts**.

If a [Twin](<../Twin.md>) casts the ❄️ ability while being boosted by the 💧 element,
enemies will be frozen ☃️ when walking on the area [(Effect fusion)](<../main-mechanic/Elements-effects.md>).
