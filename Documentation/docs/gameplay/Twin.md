The Twin is the character the player plays.

## 🎮️ Controls

Each Twin needs to select it's input device between:

* Mouse & Keyboard:
    * Aim \[Mouse\]
    * Move \[Keyboard\]
    * Abilities \[Keyboard\]
    * Attack \[Mouse\]
* Controller:
    * Aim \[Right joystick\]
    * Move \[Left joystick\]
    * Abilities \[Left bumper\]
    * Attack \[Right bumper\]

## 🎥 Camera

The camera will be placed top-down on a isometric 45° angle. 

It needs to always be filming both Twins. It will be dynamically placed  at an equidistance between both Twins and will zoom in/out to keep them in sight.

## 🏃 Movement

The movements and rotations are based on the screen position, meaning wherever the Twin may be looking if the player push his joystick up, the Twin will move upwards on the map.

The Twin has to always be facing the direction he is aiming at, independently of the direction he is running towards.

## ❤️ Health system

The Twins are sharing a same health bar, since the death of one brings the other's. <br/>
When dying, Twins are teleported to their previous spawn point.
