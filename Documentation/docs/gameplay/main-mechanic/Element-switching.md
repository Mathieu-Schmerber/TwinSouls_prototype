## Vote system

As mentioned earlier, [Twin](<../Twin.md>)s can dynamically switch of elements during the game. However a [Twin](<../Twin.md>) cannot switch element without the consent the other one, Twin Souls is a cooperation game after all !

When a [Twin](<../Twin.md>) wants to switch of element, he needs to emit a vote on an element he picked from the [üé° Elements equality wheel](<Elements-equality-wheel.md>). The [Twin](<../Twin.md>) can change his vote after emitting it.

Whenever the other [Twin](<../Twin.md>) emits a vote to switch to another element, the switch is applied confirming the vote.

> üí° **Example**
>
> The first [Twin](<../Twin.md>) votes for the fire element. Whenever the other [Twin](<../Twin.md>) wants, he votes for the lighting element. The votes get submitted, the first [Twin](<../Twin.md>) changes to fire while the other [Twin](<../Twin.md>) changes to lightning

## Link input

After the vote ends, the [Twin](<../Twin.md>)s will start inputting their elements in the link, the elements take **{x}** seconds to reach their destinations in the link, before resulting in any combination state.
