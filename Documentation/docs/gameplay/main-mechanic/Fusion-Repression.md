## Explanation under the Link context

**Fusion**

> 📕 **Definition** : A fusion occurs when each [Twin](<../Twin.md>) has inputted complementary elements in accordance to the [🎡 Elements equality wheel](<Elements-equality-wheel.md>).
>
> ⚛️ **Result **:  Whenever a fusion occurs throughout the link, each [Twin](<../Twin.md>)'s magic gets enhanced by his sibling's element effect.
>
> 👁️ **Feedback: **The players can see the elements intersecting from one [Twin](<../Twin.md>) to the other.

**Repression**

> 📕 **Definition** : A repression occurs when each [Twin](<../Twin.md>) has inputted non-complementary or unsimilar elements.
>
> In the case of a repression, we call "repressed" the [Twin](<../Twin.md>) emitting the weak element and "repressor" the [Twin](<../Twin.md>) emitting the strong element taking over the link.
>
> ⚛️ **Result **: The repressed [Twin](<../Twin.md>) gets affected by the repressor element's effect, harming the repressed [Twin](<../Twin.md>) while the repression is active (can get lethal). 
>
> The repressed [Twin](<../Twin.md>) is now unable to cast spells and can only attack by physical means.
>
> The repressor [Twin](<../Twin.md>) can still act as if no changes were made to the link. 
>
> 👁️ **Feedback : **The players can see the strong element taking over the weak element throughout the link. The strong element reaches the repressed [Twin](<../Twin.md>) while the weak element comes back to him as well, erasing the weak element presence.

## ⚠️ General context

Even though the concepts of Fusion and Regression can be observed throughout the Link between both [Twin](<../Twin.md>)s, the cause of such an event does not result from [Twin](<../Twin.md>)s emitting elements but rather in the elements' effects combination.

As such, we could talk about a Fusion or a Regression whenever an effect combination is observed. The effect's combination actors could be [Twin](<../Twin.md>)s as well as elemental monsters or even elemental traps.
