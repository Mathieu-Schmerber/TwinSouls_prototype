[Twin](<../Twin.md>)s are linked together with a magical bond. The link is unmaterial, meaning it is not possible to collide with it. It extends and retracts indefinitely depending on the [Twin](<../Twin.md>)s positions.

Each [Twin](<../Twin.md>) can input a magical element into the link, causing element combinations. The magical element a [Twin](<../Twin.md>) is inputing can be selected from the [ðŸŽ¡ Elements equality wheel](<Elements-equality-wheel.md>).

Combination outcomes can affect the link, leading to three different possible state:

* ðŸš« Cancellation 

  â†’ Both elements constantly collides at the very center of the link

  â†’ [Twin](<../Twin.md>)s can act freely

* ðŸ”ª Repression

  â†’ One of the two elements takes over the other, reaching the other [Twin](<../Twin.md>)

  â†’ The repressed [Twin](<../Twin.md>) is now constantly affected by the other one

  â†’ The repressed [Twin](<../Twin.md>) is harmed, can get lethal

  â†’ The repressing [Twin](<../Twin.md>) can act freely

* ðŸŒŸ Fusion 

  â†’ Both elements are complementary and reach both [Twin](<../Twin.md>)s

  â†’ Each [Twin](<../Twin.md>) is now constantly enhanced by the other [Twin](<../Twin.md>)'s element
