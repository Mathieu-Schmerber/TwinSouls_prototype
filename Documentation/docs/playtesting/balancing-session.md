For this session, I invited both groups from [Discovery session #1](<discovery-session1.md>) and [Discovery session #2](<discovery-session2.md>) to checkout the state of the prototype after all the tweaking.

Every players were satisfied with the new changes on the puzzle side. So I created new build moving the initial spawn point directly into the [Area 4 - Training ground](<../prototype/area4.md>) to players could spend time testing every weapon against the [Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates](<../prototype/area5.md>).

In total, there were 2 balancing sessions on the "fight only" build.

### Tweaking

Here is the list of tweaking done after the balancing sessions, taking the testers inputs into account: 

* 🔥 Burning effect: 5 damages/second → 10 damages/second
* ❤️ Twin health bar: 100hp → 200hp
* Axe: 
    * Melee damage: 10 → 15 (first attack) 10 → 7 (second attack which contains two hits)
    * Projectile damage: 15  → 10
    * Projectile speed: 10 → 12
* Sword:
    * Melee damage: 8 → 5 (first attack) 5 → 7 (second attack which contains two hits)
    * Projectile damage: 7 → 5
* Staff:
    * Projectile damage: 7 → 10
    * Projectile speed: 12 → 15
* Bow:
    * Projectile damage: 15 → 30 (one shot)
    * Melee damage: 5 → 0 (no melee allowed)
    * Can now pierce through 2 entities

Weapons now have better identities as their caracteristics and play style are very different from each other. The bow is designed as a more skilled weapon, most likely a coin flip choice, if you are not aiming correctly you are useless since no melee damage are possible at all.
