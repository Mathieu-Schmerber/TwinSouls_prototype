### Play testing sessions

Play testing will be split into two different categories:

* **Discovery sessions**:
> Sessions were the two testers playing are discovering the game for the first time.
> Those sessions will most likely end up in feedback reworking

* **Balancing sessions**:
> Sessions were the two testers already know the game.
> Those sessions will probably focus on the fighting part of the prototype level.

### Play testing plan

I will always be spectating the testers playing Twin Souls and will be taking notes of each area crossed by the players.
Each note will be stored in the following section.

**Discovery sessions**

Discovery sessions will require extra care, as the mechanics are very complex.

Players will be quickly briefed before each session about the element ecosystem along side the voting.
The [🎡 Elements equality wheel](<../gameplay/main-mechanic/Elements-equality-wheel.md>) graph will be provided to the testers as well.

When reaching the [Area 4 - Training ground](<../prototype/area4.md>) testers will be briefed more in-depth about the combat mechanic and how elements are working in this environment.

At the moment, the number of discovery sessions is not defined.

**Balancing sessions**

Balancing sessions will probably be very quick since testers will already know about the game.
However, the number of balancing sessions is not planned yet.
