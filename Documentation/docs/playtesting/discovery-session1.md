Both player joined the game, using Xbox controllers and the Parsec software in order to play Twin Souls online.

Players in this session have never even opened the game before.

### [Area 1 - Pressure plate](<../prototype/area1.md>)

Both player used this very simple area to start moving around, testing the movement abilities and swinging their axes, enjoying the simple fireball spell casting.

While moving around, players started switching their elements over randomly and ended up dying 2 times to [🔍️ Fusion & Repression](<../gameplay/main-mechanic/Fusion-Repression.md>) caused by the 🔥 burning effect.

The actual activation of the two pressure plates went very smoothly, players instantly knew what they had to do.

### [Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates](<../prototype/area2.md>)

Both player were very confused at first. After moving and shooting around, they understood that boxes could be affected by spells and be moved as well. With that in mind, players easily understood how to trigger the 4 pressure plates.

Seeing the door not opening, they started to ask what the pillars were about. After shooting the pillars for a couple of minutes, players finally figured out that the 4 pillars were actually switches. Activating the first ❄️ 💧 pillar was easy enough, but the players took a fair amount of time to think about both using the same element to activate the ⚡️ pillar.

Activating the ⚡️ 💧 pillar was a real struggle and players came up with very complex setups, before realizing that the activation time of this last pillar was far greater than the others. Players made it in the intended way (both using ⚡️ then both using 💧).

During this area, players died once to [🔍️ Fusion & Repression](<../gameplay/main-mechanic/Fusion-Repression.md>) caused by the 🔥 burning effect.

### [Area 3 - Movement ability](<../prototype/area3.md>)

This part went very smoothly since both players thoroughly enjoyed dashing around since the very beginning. They quickly realised that the boxes could have timers on them, and that they had to use the ❄️mobility ability, however it did take some time to come to this ability usage conclusion since they started by shooting as quickly as possible.

### [Area 4 - Training ground](<../prototype/area4.md>)

Player A was quite in a rush to skip this area without really caring much about it, but was restricted by Player B since both players are required to open the door.

Player B spent quite some time playing around with the weapon choices. This player really cared about finding out how the element combinations worked together by hitting the dummies. This was a great show, as Player B needed to also share with Player A what were discovered.

Both players started to understand how complex the system was and were very confused, starting to realise that they will need to be using their head more from now on.

### [Area 5 - Monster waves](<../prototype/area5.md>)

Players died 3 times during the first wave since they didn't realize how communication was important whenever switching elements.

Players complained a lot about the speed of the enemies being to great and their aim being nearly perfect. It took another 2 deaths for them to realise that they could use their movement abilities to dodge spells and even damage enemies.

In total, players died 7 times.

### Conclusion

The game is lacking feedbacks on the puzzle side, where on the combat side enemies are probably to strong. Also players died a lot to [🔍️ Fusion & Repression](<../gameplay/main-mechanic/Fusion-Repression.md>), so the 🔥 burning effect needs to be reduced.

### Tweaking

* 🔥 burning effect: 10 damages/second → 5 damages/second
* 🏹 bow: 
    * projectile speed: 15 units → 20 units
* [Area 2 - Pillars & pressure plates](<../prototype/area2.md>): 
    * By default a pillar is active, this will help the players understand that every pillars should be lighten up.
    * Pillars have now a visual cooldown wheel effect before turning back, this way players will figure out quicker that pillars are bound to reset after a change
* [Area 5 - Monster waves](<../prototype/area5.md>):
    * Monsters:
        * 👟 speed: 6.5 units → 5.5 units
        * ❤️ health: 10 hp → 20 hp (since enemies are slower, they will dodge less projectiles)
